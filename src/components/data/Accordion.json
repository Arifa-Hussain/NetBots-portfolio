        "description": "The MERN Stack course covers the fundamentals and practical skills needed to build full-stack web applications using the following technologies:\n\n1. MongoDB (Database): Learn to design, store, and retrieve data using this NoSQL database, including CRUD operations, schema design, and aggregation.\n\n2. Express.js (Backend Framework): Build server-side APIs and handle HTTP requests with Express, focusing on routing, middleware, and RESTful API development.\n\n3. React.js (Frontend Framework): Create dynamic, user-friendly interfaces with React, covering components, state management, hooks, and connecting to backend APIs.\n\n4. Node.js (Runtime Environment): Use Node.js to run JavaScript on the server, handling asynchronous operations and integrating Express with MongoDB.\nKey Topics:\n- Setting up a MERN stack development environment.\n- Building a complete project: Frontend (React) + Backend (Node + Express) + Database (MongoDB).\n- User authentication (JWT, OAuth) and session management.\n- Deployment to platforms like Heroku or Vercel.\n- Best practices for scalable, secure, and maintainable code."
